# Hey! ğŸ‘‹

I'm Amin, I love coding and all things geek ğŸ¤“.

I'm originally from Iran ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡·, lived in Turkey ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡· for a few years, and I'm now based in the Netherlands ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡±.

I enjoy staying active (gym, swimming, adventure motorcycling), getting creative (cooking and photography), learning (reading, DIY projects) and finding balance by camping in nature.
